# mofn
  matlab code.
Method of creating minimal-order Markov set and transition states of m/n sliding window.  

The following functions get from paper "Analysis and Design of Sliding m-of-n Detectors":  

- mofn_setup_opt
- binnum
- addhexad_opt
- reduce_hexad

These are old methods.

The following functions using new method to create minimal-order Markovset.

- mofn_setup_opt2
- mofn_hp
- mofn_hm
- mofn_w
