# mofn
Method of creating minimal-order Markov set and transition states of m/n sliding window.
The following functions get from paper "Analysis and Design of Sliding m-of-n Detectors":
  1. mofn_setup_opt
  2. binnum
  3. addhexad_opt
  4. reduce_hexad
These are old method.
The following functions using new method to create minimal-order Markov.
  1. mofn_setup_opt2
  2. mofn_hp
  3. mofn_hm
  4. mofn_w
